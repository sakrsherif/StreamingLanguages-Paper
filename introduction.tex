\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

We have entered the big-data era: the world is awash with data, and
more of it is produced every minute of every day. Data analytics
solutions must contend with big data both in the static-data sense of
an ocean of many bytes and in the streaming sense of a firehose of
many bytes-per-second. In fact, the data technology industry is
focusing increasingly on data-in-motion.  The point of view is that
static data is merely a snapshot of parts of a data stream. Analyzing
the stream instead of the ocean yields more timely insights and saves
storage resources.

- motivation
  - unpack the title
  - importance and rise of big-data and of streaming
  - benefits of languages
  - diversity of languages, lack of standard
  - lack of a recent survey \cite{stephens_1997} \cite{johnston_hanna_millar_2004}
- background / definitions
  - stream, streaming application, DSL, stream processing language
  - requirements: performance, generality, productivity
  - most streaming languages are declarative, so the traditional
    paradigm categories imperative or functional don't apply
- common ideas/principles/tropes:
  - streaming specific
    - keep syntax of non-streaming featurs similar to non-streaming languages
    - to-and-from static
    - reactivity as a pun
    - graph of operators
  - general
    - keep concepts orthogonal (independent, composable, and regular)
    - unify similar concept into a single, more general concept
    - reserve the most concise syntax for the most common tasks
    - keep the core language slim by enabling extensions in the library
    - keep the syntax of definitions, declarations, and uses similar
    - follow the code direction with both scope and control dominance
    - favor restrictions that simultaneously improve performance and safety
- roadmap for rest of paper
- take-home message: democratization of streaming
