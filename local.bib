abstract = {Stream reasoning studies the application of inference techniques to data characterised by being highly dynamic. It can find application in several settings, from Smart Cities to Industry 4.0, from Internet of Things to Social Media analytics. This year stream reasoning turns ten, and in this article we analyse its growth. In the first part, we trace the main results obtained so far, by presenting the most prominent studies. We start by an overview of the most relevant studies developed in the context of semantic web, and then we extend the analysis to include contributions from adjacent areas, such as database and artificial intelligence. Looking at the past is useful to prepare for the future: in the second part, we present a set of open challenges and issues that stream reasoning will face in the next future.},
