\section{Principles}\label{sec:principles}

\begin{alltt}TODO\scriptsize
- streaming specific
  - keep syntax of non-streaming featurs similar to non-streaming languages
  - to-and-from static
  - reactivity as a pun
  - graph of operators
- general
  - keep concepts orthogonal (independent, composable, and regular)
  - unify similar concept into a single, more general concept
  - reserve the most concise syntax for the most common tasks
  - keep the core language slim by enabling extensions in the library
  - keep the syntax of definitions, declarations, and uses similar
  - follow the code direction with both scope and control dominance
  - favor restrictions that simultaneously improve performance and safety
