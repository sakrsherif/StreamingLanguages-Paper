\section{Stream Processing Languages}\label{sec:languages}

This section surveys eight styles of stream processing languages.  The
subsections for each introduce one exemplary language, followed by a
brief discussion of important other languages of the same style. The
descriptions of the exemplary languages answer the following
``w''-questions:

\begin{description}
  \item[Why:] objective, audience, domain
  \item[Who:] inventors, supporters
  \item[When:] first appearance
  \item[What:] key idea, data model, code example
  \item[Where:] locus of development and offering
  \item[Whence:] influenced-by and influences
\end{description}

Overall, there is much diversity in stream processing languages,
stemming from different primary objectives, data models, and ways of
thinking.
