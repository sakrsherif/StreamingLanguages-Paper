\section{Stream Processing Languages}\label{sec:languages}

In general, there is much diversity in stream processing languages,
stemming from different primary objectives, data models, and ways of
thinking. This section surveys seven styles of stream processing languages.  Each
subsection introduces one of these styles using an exemplary language, followed by a
brief discussion of important other languages of the same style. The
descriptions of the exemplary languages answer the following
``w''-questions:

\begin{description}
  \item[Why:] objective, audience, domain.
  \item[Who:] inventors, supporters.
  \item[When:] first appearance.
  \item[What:] key idea, data model, code example.
%  \item[Where:] locus of development and offering.
  \item[Whence \& whither:] influenced-by \& influences.
\end{description}
