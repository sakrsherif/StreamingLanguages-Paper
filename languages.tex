\section{Stream Processing Languages}\label{sec:languages}



\begin{alltt}TODO\scriptsize ~2.8 pages total
- this section will have ~0.3 pages about each language, and
  each of these snippets will be structured around questions:
  why-who-when-what-where-whence
  (see CQL for an example, but the others will be similar!)
- before the snippets on each of the languages, we will briefly
  introduce and explain these questions, as follows:
  - why: objective, audience, domain
  - who: inventors, supporters
  - when: first release / first paper
  - what: key idea, data model, type system, code example
  - where: being developed or offered today, license
  - whence: influenced-by and influences
- descriptions of individual languages
  - relational / CQL \cite{arasu_babu_widom_2006}   \textcolor{red}{Sherif}
    - why: precise semantics \cite{arasu_widom_2004}, example app linear-road \cite{arasu_et_al_2004}
    - who: Arasu/Widom at Stanford
    - when: 2004
    - what: algebra of R2R (relational), S2R (windows), R2S (I/R/D);
      data model relational; type system \cite{soule_et_al_2016}; example Figure~\ref{fig:cql}
    - where: Stanford STREAM no longer active
    - whence: influenced-by TelegraphCQ \cite{chandrasekaran_et_al_2003},
      influences StreamInsight \cite{ali_et_al_2009} and many others
  - synchronous dataflow / Lustre \cite{caspi_et_al_1987} \textcolor{red}{Guillaume}
  - big-data streaming / SPL \cite{hirzel_schneider_gedik_2017} \textcolor{red}{Martin, Emanuele}
  - CEP (complex event processing) / MATCH-RECOGNIZE \cite{zemke_et_al_2007} \cite{hirzel_2012} \color{red}{Angela}
  - XML / NiagaraCQ \cite{chen_et_al_2000}, YFilter \cite{diao_et_al_2002} \textcolor{red}{Sherif}
  - RDF / C-SPARQL \cite{barbieri_et_al_2009} \textcolor{red}{Emanuele, Akrivi}
  - stream reasoning \textcolor{red}{Emanuele}
  - reactive spreadsheets / ActiveSheets \cite{vaziri_et_al_2014} \textcolor{red}{Martin}
  - controlled natural language / META \cite{arnold_et_al_2016} \textcolor{red}{Martin}
- close with summary/comparison table
  - perhaps according to performance/generality/productivity

In 2004, Arasu et al.~\cite{arasu_widom_2004} introduced  \texttt{CQL} (\textbf{C}ontinuous \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{L}anguage) as part of Stanford prototype system for data stream management, \texttt{STREAM}\footnote{\url{http://infolab.stanford.edu/stream/}}. CQL has been designed as an SQL-based declarative language for implementing continuous queries against streams of data. The design of this language has been influenced by the language of the \texttt{TelegraphCQ} system\footnote{\url{http://telegraph.cs.berkeley.edu/telegraphcq/v0.2/}} that proposed as a declarative language with a particular focus on expressive windowing constructs~\cite{chandrasekaran_et_al_2003}. The abstract semantics of CQL is based on two data types: \emph{streams} and \emph{relations}. It supports three classes of operators over
these types: 1) \emph{stream-to-relation} operators: They produce a relation from a stream.  The design of these operators is based on the concept of a \emph{sliding window} over a stream, a window that at any point of time contains a historical snapshot of a finite portion of the stream. The definition of this sliding windows can be specified as \emph{time-based}, \emph{tuple-based},
or \emph{partitioned}. 2) \emph{relation-to-relation} operators: they produce a relation from other relations. These operators are derived from traditional relational queries and are expressed using standard SQL. 3) \emph{stream-to-relation} operators: they produce a stream from a relation. CQL supports three operators of this class \emph{IStream} (Insert Stream), \emph{DStream} (Delete Stream), and \emph{RStream} (Relation Stream).  Figure~\ref{fig:cql} illustrates a CQL code example that uses a time-sliding window (per minute within the last 24 hours) over a stream-to-relation operator (IStream) of phone calls to return the maximum phone call length and the maximum number of calls with the caller information \textcolor{red}{Please Martin check if the query description is accurate}. CQL has influenced the design of many systems such as \texttt{Microsoft StreamInsight}\footnote{\url{https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee362541(sql.105).aspx}} which has been designed as a platform to develop and deploy complex event processing (CEP) applications~\cite{ali_et_al_2009}.
