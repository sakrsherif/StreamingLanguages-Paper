\section{Stream Processing Languages}\label{sec:languages}

\begin{alltt}TODO\scriptsize ~6 pages total
- this section discusses 8 styles of streaming languages
  - ~1 column and ~8 citations for each language style
  - each of these snippets structured around questions:
    why-who-when-what-where-whence
  - for each language style, we first discuss one
    representative language in detail (including a code
    example), then briefly review other related languages
- before the snippets on each of the languages/styles, we will
  briefly introduce and explain these questions, as follows:
  - why: objective, audience, domain
  - who: inventors, supporters
  - when: first release / first paper
  - what: key idea, data model, type system, code example
  - where: being developed or offered today, license
  - whence: influenced-by and influences
- descriptions of individual language styles
