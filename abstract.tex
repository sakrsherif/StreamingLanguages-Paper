This paper is a survey of recent stream processing languages, which
are programming languages for writing applications that analyze data
streams. Data streams, or continuous data flows, have been around for
decades. But with the advent of the big-data era, they have
dramatically increased in size. Analyzing big data streams yields
immense advantages across all sectors of our society. But to analyze
streams, one needs to write a stream processing application. This
paper showcases several languages designed for this purpose,
highlights underlying principles, and outlines open challenges.
