\section{What's Next?}\label{sec:whatsnext}

In the Big Data area, the need to process and analyze high volume of data is a fundamental problem for modern applications. As mentioned in~\cite{jagadish2014bigdata} industry analysis companies point out that there are challenges not just in Volume, but also in Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, therefore the applications and challenges should not focus only in the first one. Streaming languages naturally handle Volume and Velocity of the data since they are design to process data real-time in a streaming way. Thus, in the following, we focus on Veracity and Variety, since there are still open research challenges in this directions despite much recent progress in streaming languages. In addition, we elaborate on the challenge of adoption which is an important problem of programming languages in general and becomes more important nowadays due to the high number of available languages and systems.

    \emph{Languages} & \emph{Veracity} & \emph{Variety} & \emph{Adoption}\\

  \caption{\label{tab:challenges}Which of the language families from
    Section~\ref{sec:languages} address which of the measures of
    streaming language challenges in Section~\ref{sec:whatsnext}
    (in bold the most occurring ones).}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:challenges} summarizes the challenges.  Compared to the
coverage of principles in Table~\ref{tab:principles}, the coverage of
challenges is more sparse and spread out over research prototypes.
That is why we tabulated it for language families instead of
individual languages. 
We have highlighted in bold the challenges that are most covered across all
the languages families. We can observe that variety is currently more
covered than veracity and adoption, thus leaving space to future work in
this area. 
Ultimately, we aim at streaming languages that are
both principled and close the gap on all challenges.
