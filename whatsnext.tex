\section{What's Next?}\label{sec:whatsnext}

Despite much recent progress in streaming languages, there are still
open research challenges, three of which this section highlights.

\subsection{Challenges Summary}

  \caption{\label{tab:challenges}Which of the language families from
    Section~\ref{sec:languages} address which of the measures of
    streaming language challenges in Section~\ref{sec:whatsnext}
    (in bold the most occurring ones).}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:challenges} summarizes the challenges.  Compared to the
coverage of principles in Table~\ref{tab:principles}, the coverage of
challenges is more sparse and spread out over research prototypes.
That is why we tabulated it for language families instead of
individual languages. 
We have highlighted in bold the challenges that are most covered across all
the languages families. We can observe that variety is currently more
covered than veracity and adoption, thus leaving space to future work in
this area. 
Ultimately, we aim at streaming languages that are
both principled and close the gap on all challenges.
